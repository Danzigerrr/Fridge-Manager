## The goal of the project
**The goal of this project is to deploy a Django web application allowing the users to manage their fridges and reduce the food waste.
The key functionality of the app is to search for recipes using the products stored currently in the fridge.**


## Main functionalities of the application

The application provides an interface and tools designed for managing products stored in a fridge.

The key functionalities include:

- **Registering a new user** - Register and log in available.
- **Setting up your fridge** - Create your fridge
- **Sharing your fridge with another users** - Use an invitation link to manage the fridge together
- **Adding products to your fridge** - Add new products by defining their name, expiration date, and amount
- **Searching for recipes** - You can search for great recipes in which you can use your products as ingredients

## Why did I create this?

By creating this app I would like to have an impact on the global food waste problem.
According to [Greenly Institute](https://greenly.earth/en-us/blog/ecology-news/global-food-waste-in-2022):

"Over a third of all food produced (~2.5 billion tons) is lost or wasted each year.
One third of this occurs in the food production stage.
Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimates this wasted food is worth $230 billion.

ðŸ‘‰ Researchers estimate the lost food calories from food waste amount to roughly 24% of the total available food calories."

Users of my app can **#ActLocallyAndThinkGlobally** by reducing their own food waste.

## Used libraries
 - Django
 
## Possible future improvements

- **Add an option to define the priority of products used as ingredients** - the user can define what products he/she wants to use today
